# DTDatastructures

This repository will hopefully grow as I reimplement some functional data structures (mostly as presented by Okasaki) in a dependently typed language.
The University of Kiel has currently a course on "Functional Programming" using Haskell.
The goal of this little project is to take the Haskell code and reimplement them in a dependently typed language (for now Agda, but I want to try Idris as well) to, for example, encode invariants directly.
Hopefully, we can then use the material in the upcomming term to impress students with these wonderful languages.
